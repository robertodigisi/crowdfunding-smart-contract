# Project summary

This is a project aimed at educating and familiarizing myself with the Solidity language for smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.

The general idea is to allow anybody to create a campaign on the blockchain. Once a campaign goes live, people can donate up until a defined deadline.

## User stories (features)
* [US01]: As a user I can start a campaign, so that I can receive ETH.
* [US02]: As a creator of a campaign I can set an ETH goal so that if not reached donators will be refound.
* [US03]: As a donator I can donate to a specific campaign, so that I contribute for it.
* [US04]: As a donator I can sent a short message with the donation, so that will be forever reminded in the blockchain.
* [US05]: As a donator I can donate randomly to opens campaign, so that I contribute randomly.
* [US06]: As a user I can see who are the top donators of a specific campaign, so that I know it.
* [US07]: As a user I can see who are the overall top donators, so that I know it.

# Future developments
At the beginning I'm going to concentrate on smart contract logic. Later on I will implement a full web app.
