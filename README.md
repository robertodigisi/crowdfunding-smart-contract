# crowdfunding-smart-contract
A smart contract written in Solidity, that uses the Ethereum blockchain.

# Project summary
This is a project aimed at educating and familiarizing myself with the Solidity language for smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.

The general idea is to allow anybody to create a campaign on the blockchain. Once a campaign goes live, people can donate up until a defined deadline.

## Implemented features
:white_check_mark As the owner I can transfer the ownership of the smart contract;
:white_check_mark As a user I can start a campaign, so that I can receive ETH;

# Upcoming features
:white_large_square As a user I can see how many campaign have been created, so that I have this information;
:white_large_square As a user I can see how much has been donated to all campaigns, so that I have this information;
:white_large_square As a donator I can donate to a specific campaign, so that I contribute for it.
:white_large_square As a donator I can sent a short message with the donation, so that will be forever reminded in the blockchain.
:white_large_square As a donator I can donate randomly to open campaigns, so that I contribute randomly just for fun.
:white_large_square As a user I can see who are the top donators of a specific campaign, so that I know it.
:white_large_square As a user I can see who are the overall top donators, so that I know it.
:white_large_square More to come ...

# Upcoming Improvements
:white_large_square Unit tests;
:white_large_square Fees optimizations;
:white_large_square Proxy upgrade pattern;
