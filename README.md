# crowdfunding-smart-contract
A smart contract written in Solidity, that uses the Ethereum blockchain.

# Project summary
This is a project aimed at educating and familiarizing myself with the Solidity language for smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.

The general idea is to allow anybody to create a campaign on the blockchain. Once a campaign goes live, people can donate up until a defined deadline.

## Implemented features
* As a user I can see how many campaign have been created so that I'm informed about it;
*

* As a user I can start a campaign, so that I can receive ETH.

# Upcoming features
* As a donator I can donate to a specific campaign, so that I contribute for it.
* As a donator I can sent a short message with the donation, so that will be forever reminded in the blockchain.
* As a donator I can donate randomly to opens campaign, so that I contribute randomly.
* As a user I can see who are the top donators of a specific campaign, so that I know it.
* As a user I can see who are the overall top donators, so that I know it.
* More to come ...
