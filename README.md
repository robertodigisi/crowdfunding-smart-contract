# Crowdfunding smart contract
A smart contract written in Solidity, that uses the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project summary
This is a project aimed at educating and familiarizing myself with the Solidity language for smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.

The general idea is to allow anybody to create a campaign on the blockchain. Once a campaign goes live, people can donate up until a defined deadline.

## Implemented and upcoming features
- [x] As the owner I can transfer the ownership of the smart contract;
- [x] As a user I can start a campaign, so that I can receive ETH;
- [ ] As a user I can see how many campaign have been created, so that I have this information;
- [ ] As a user I can see how much has been donated to all campaigns, so that I have this information;
- [ ] As a donator I can donate to a specific campaign, so that I contribute for it.
- [ ] As a donator I can sent a short message with the donation, so that will be forever reminded in the blockchain.
- [ ] As a donator I can donate randomly to open campaigns, so that I contribute randomly just for fun.
- [ ] As a user I can see who are the top donators of a specific campaign, so that I know it.
- [ ] As a user I can see who are the overall top donators, so that I know it.
- [ ] More to come ...

## Implemented and upcoming improvements
- [ ] Unit tests;
- [ ] Fees optimizations;
- [ ] Proxy upgrade pattern;
